## SOZ CHAIN PART 1 By Seljuk Shah

  soz.maintitle1.t:0 "The Sword of Zengi"
  soz_actone_branchone.1.desc:0 "I run into Ismat on my way to our sleeping quarters. There's not a servant in sight and I hesitate; there's been talk of her hiding the sword of her late husband from me. The blade of Zengi. Ismat glances at me, "What is it? You have that look again when you're deciding which horse to take on a hunt." She smiles, crossing her arms and waiting for me to say what is on my mind. \n\nI could demand the sword from her as her liege and rightful owner of such an important relic. But then again, Ismat was never a woman to be intimidated so easily. She's always been an easy person to speak with and I would hate to ruin our companionship."
